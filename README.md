# pkg-starter

This is a starter repository for building command line utils using NodeJS & the `pkg` package.

## Inpsiration

I started exploring `pkg` to create a small notification utility for the build server where I work. Ideally this would run without Node installed on the server. This work inspired me to create this template after building the basic logic to parse command line arguments into an easy to use format.

## How to Use

To use this, simply open `src/main.js` and start coding where the `console.log` statement is. Command line should be passed in the following format;

```
myexe.exe --my-arg=argvalue
```

The function `helpers.parseArgs()` will convert arguments into an object that can be accessed from `main.js` like so;

```js
args['my-arg'] // returns 'argvalue'
```

Argument values that include spaces should be wrapped in quotes.

## Building the Project

To get started, first install `pkg` globally;

```
npm install -g pkg
```

Then build the project by running;

```
npm run build
```

You should receive a set of binaries for Windows, Mac, and Linux in the `./dist` directory.

> ‚ùó I only tested this on Windows. I'd love to hear if this also works on Mac & Linux.
